Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was one of the players at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.</p>

                    <h3>Chet Baker</h3>
                     <p>Hailed as the poster boy of west coast cool jazz in the 1950s for his chiseled movie star looks, Oklahoma-born Chet Baker first made his mark playing trumpet in saxophonist Gerry Mulligan’s quartet before expanding his fanbase by singing on his records in a dreamy, androgynous croon. Though Baker’s languid vocals transformed him into a pop idol in the eyes of teenage girls, they were rarely to the critics’ liking, who preferred his horn playing with its gorgeously lyrical tone. Sadly, drug addiction and jail time regularly derailed Baker’s career but he managed to get it back on track in the 1980s.</p>
